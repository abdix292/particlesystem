# Particle System Animation
Animation of a shooting star explosion in space utilizing particle systems, basic flocking approaches, user interactions, and a 3D camera. Shooting star explosion stars at the corner of the animation with a 3D planet orbiting in space and its moon behind creating a shadow effect on the planet. When animation starts, stars(boids) flock through space and create an explosion following it with smaller stars/particles exploding. Animation will restart once the mouse is clicked, pause when backspace/delete is clicked, and resume when enter is pressed.
